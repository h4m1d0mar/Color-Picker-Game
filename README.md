# Color-Picker-Game
A web based application built using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. The aim of this project is to learn basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and 
apply it to something useful and maybe even a little fun!

It follows a very basic HTML structure, using six div tags shaped in the form of squares, and colored in different shades generated 
randomly by the JavaScript Code. The title on top of the screen depicts an RGB value, which players have to match with the divs below. 
You win the game by matching the correct colored box with the RGB value in the title.

The game can be refreshed by clicking, which reassigns colors to all boxes and gives a new RGB value in the title. 

The game also provides different difficulty modes, which alter the number of boxes to choose from. Choosing the easy mode for example will
only present the players with three boxes to choose from.
